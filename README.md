We all want to travel, but sometimes we would like some information before we decide where we want to go next. 
We wanted to create a place where people from all over the world can visit to get some information about different countries they might want to travel too.  
This webpage will provide the web page visitor with the following information
-The capital of the country, which is usually the place the main airport is located and usually the place where your journey into the country will start.
-The Population, which might give you an idea as to how crowded or how much people you can meet.
-The Language, which once you know the language you can download the duolingo app and get some practice for basic phrases before you visit so you don't get lost in translation.
The Currency, which is super helpful so you can start doing some conversions and also order the currency at your local financial institution before you travel. 
-It also provides the current weather in the capital city to give you an idea as to what to expect and what kind of attire to wear on your fun journey.
